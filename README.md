Problem 1: Calculator using Class
Description
A calculator program that performs basic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) using a class.
Inputs:
a → first number (float)
b → second number (float)
operation → type of operation (string: "add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide")
Key Points
Uses a class Calculator with a method calculate().


Problem 2: Generate Odd Number Series
Description
Given an integer a, generate a series of the first a odd numbers.
Example
Input: a = 4
Output: 1, 3, 5, 7
Key Points
Loop runs a times.
Each odd number generated by formula 2*i + 1.



Problem 3: Custom Odd Number Series
Description
Given an integer a, generate a series of odd numbers with a twist:
If a is odd → print first a odd numbers.
If a is even → print first a-1 odd numbers.
Example
Input: a = 2 → Output: 1
Input: a = 3 → Output: 1, 3, 5
Input: a = 6 → Output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
Key Points
Adjusts length of the series based on whether a is odd or even.


Problem 4: Count Multiples in List
Description
Given a list of integers, count how many numbers are divisible by each integer from 1 to 9.
Example
Input:
[1,2,8,9,12,46,76,82,15,20,30]
Output:

{1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}
Key Points:
Uses dictionary comprehension to initialize counts.
Checks divisibility of each element by numbers 1 to 9.
